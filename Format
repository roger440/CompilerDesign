First Line : all states
Second line : alphabet
Third line : transitions
Fourth line : final accepted states

The algorithm can read a FiniteAutomata, store it in memory, display all the characteristics and establish whether
a pattern matches it or not, returning true or false. There is a UI menu which can be used in order to operate it.
The 2 automata which I wrote should match and replace the Constant and Identifier Regex
They iterate through the string given and if at some point we cannot find a transition for which we advance,
it returns false. If it reaches the end and the state is among the accepted states, it returns true
If it doesnt't find the current state in the final states, it returns false
